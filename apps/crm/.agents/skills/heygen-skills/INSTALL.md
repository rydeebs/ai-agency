# Install HeyGen Skills

Grab an [API key](https://app.heygen.com/api) and set it in your shell. If you're already on a HeyGen plan with MCP connected to your agent, you can skip the key — MCP will be used automatically.

The repo ships *three* skills you can install:

- **`heygen-avatar`** — build a persistent digital identity from a photo or description
- **`heygen-video`** — generate identity-first presenter videos
- **`heygen-translate`** — translate / dub existing videos into 175+ languages with voice cloning and lip-sync

Most users want avatar + video together. They chain: `heygen-avatar` returns an avatar id that `heygen-video` consumes. `heygen-translate` is independent — install it whenever you need to localize finished videos.

## Option 1 — `gh skill install` (works across 12+ agents)

If you have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) v2.90+ available, this is the most portable install. `gh skill` writes to the right directory for your agent automatically (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Junie, Goose, OpenHands, Amp, Cline, OpenCode, Warp, and more):

```bash
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-avatar
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-video
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-translate
```

Project scope (current repo only) is the default. For user scope (every project on this machine):

```bash
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-avatar    --scope user
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-video     --scope user
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-translate --scope user
```

Pin to a release tag for reproducibility:

```bash
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-avatar@v3.1.0    --pin
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-video@v3.1.0     --pin
gh skill install heygen-com/skills heygen-translate@v3.1.0 --pin
```

## Option 2 — ClawHub

```bash
clawhub install heygen-skills
```

ClawHub installs all three skills to your agent's default skills directory automatically.

## Option 3 — OpenClaw plugin

For OpenClaw users who want bundled MCP support too:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@heygen/openclaw-plugin-heygen
```

## Option 4 — Git clone

Clone into your agent's skills directory:

**OpenClaw** (default: `~/.openclaw/skills/heygen-skills`, custom installs may differ — check your config):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heygen-com/skills.git ~/.openclaw/skills/heygen-skills
```

**Claude Code** (default: `~/.claude/skills/heygen-skills`):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heygen-com/skills.git ~/.claude/skills/heygen-skills
```

> Not sure where your skills directory is? Ask your agent: *"Where is your skills directory?"*

## Auth

Two auth modes with explicit priority:

| Priority | Mode | Trigger | Billing |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **CLI (API key)** | `HEYGEN_API_KEY` is set | Direct API usage (separately billed) |
| 2 | **MCP (OAuth)** | MCP tools visible AND no API key | HeyGen plan credits (existing subscription) |
| 3 | **CLI (fallback)** | `heygen auth login` session | Direct API usage |

**CLI with API key (recommended for agents):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://static.heygen.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
export HEYGEN_API_KEY=<your-key>
heygen --version        # verify binary is on PATH
heygen auth status      # verify auth
```

> If `HEYGEN_API_KEY` is set, the skills use the CLI. This is the most predictable setup for agent workflows.

**MCP (zero-setup if on a HeyGen plan):** connect HeyGen's remote MCP server to your agent — OAuth handles auth, calls use your existing plan credits. See README for agent-specific setup.

## First Run

Paste this prompt to your agent — it will find the right paths automatically:

> Install the HeyGen Skills from https://github.com/heygen-com/skills.git — clone it into your skills directory (find it with your config or ask if unsure). Install the HeyGen CLI via `curl -fsSL https://static.heygen.ai/cli/install.sh | bash` and export HEYGEN_API_KEY=\<your-key\> (get one at https://app.heygen.com/api). Or, if you're on a HeyGen plan and already have MCP connected to your agent, skip the key step — MCP will be used automatically. Then use the heygen-avatar skill to create an avatar for me, and heygen-video to make a 30-60 second intro video, casual tone.
